# Polyphemitis Artwork
This program generated the cover artwork for my single "Polyphemitis".
Now you can make your own *unique* version of the graphic.

Java and Processing need to be installed. Download the files and copy all of them into a new folder with the name "EyefloodGenerator".
Or easier, just open the .pde file and Processing will ask you if you want that to happen automatically.
Run the code by clicking on the start button (obviously). You will see eyes popping up, being distorted and flowing into each other.
You can stop the generation process by clicking the left mouse button. Some coloring will be applied and the final result is saved in the folder.
Have fun (and also listen to the song <3).
